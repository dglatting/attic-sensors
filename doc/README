Where to start?

Clone the code, type "make", and see what happens. I cannot tell you the code's dependencies because I didn't record them, but they exist such as a requisite compiler and i2c libraries. There are other informational files in the "doc" directory but the source is the ultimate information repository. 

FAQ

Why is my attic so warm in October?
Just below part of my attic is my data center whose warm air is vented into the attic. I needed to cool my data center but I also wanted to force the hot air out of the attic but I cannot directly install outside venting due to association rules. Therefore, I had to work with what I got.

Why am I underutilizing the Enviro pHat?
I thought the pHAT was dead due to previous abuse and, so, I was surprised the A/D converter still worked. I didn't trust the temperature sensor and I didn't need the pHAT's other sensors - what is the motion sensor going to do for me when the sensor array is static? Note, I plan to write c++ code for the Environ pHAT+ for another project.

What's with revision history embedded in the code?
Simple, I use RCS and configured the files to include revision information. I personally like revision comments embedded in files because the information is right there - in front of me, rather than to issue additional commands to see them. Also, I don't yet have a git server running (another story).

Munin graphs Fahrenheit?
Yes. I'm American. 

Can I believe the readings?
Got me. I don't have the equipment to check/calibrate the sensor readings.
